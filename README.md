This is a website made for my final project on MindX, developed by a frontend student who have no idea what a database is and how to use it. 
A customizable e-commercial website, with data stored inside localStorage.
No data from the end user is collected from this website.
When sending a receipt, the website uses EmailJS, a third-party non-open-sourced service.
See it's term and services at https://www.emailjs.com/legal/terms-of-service/.

the about page is a massive shitpost
